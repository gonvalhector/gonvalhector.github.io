# About Me

Hi! My name is Hector Gonzalez, I'm 26 years old and I'm from Mexico.
I'm studying to become a professional web developer and I also do [art]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link gallery.html %}) for fun.  
So far I've completed the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course and I'm
currently finishing the CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
